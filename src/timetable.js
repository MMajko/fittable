/**
* @typedef Grid
* @type Object
* @property {number} starts - Start time of the day in decimal hours, e.g. 7:30 is `7.5`.
* @property {number} ends - End time of the day in decimal hours, e.g. 21:30 is `21.5`.
* @property {boolean} facultyGrid - Whether to display grid in faculty hours, or using real clock
*                    hours.
* @property {number} lessonDuration - How long is one teaching hour with a break,
*                    as a fraction of real hour, e.g. two teaching hours are 90 minutes
                     w/ 15 minutes break. Therefore one teaching hour is 52.5 minutes,
                     which is 0.875. If facultyGrid is false, this is 1, i.e. a real clock hour.
* @property {number} facultyHours - How many teaching hours are in one day.
* @property {boolean} hoursStartsAt1 - Whether the first hour is numbered by 1, usually corresponds
*                     to facultyGrid.

 * @property {number} duration - Total duration of the "teaching day" in seconds.
 * @property {number} hourDuration - Duration of a teaching hour in seconds.
 * @property {number} hours - Count of teaching hours in one day.
 * @property {number} firstHour - Number of the first displayed hour; 1 if faculty grid is enabled,
 *                    real clock hour rounded to the nearest full hour otherwise, e.g. `7:30 â†’ 8`.
 * @property {number} offset - Distance from the firstHour defined as a fraction (0 to 1).
 *                    0 for faculty grid, since the firstHour has no offset.
 *                    Otherwise this is calculated as modulo, e.g. 7:30 becomes 0.5, since
 *                    grid.starts is `7.5` and `7.5 mod 1 = 0.5`.
