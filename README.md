**Fittable widget** is lightweight JavaScript widget used for displaying timetables and calendars for various applications. Offers subtle, flat and intuitive user interface. And it should be **more fittable** than any other timetable widget :blush:

Using JavaScript ES6+ code (converting to ES5 using [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)) makes the widget ready for new technologies and development trends in+ JavaScript language.

Offers quick implementation into another applications through simple Javascript API layer. For more information how to use this widget, visit [our wiki](https://github.com/cvut/fittable-widget/wiki).

## Installation

### Requirements

You will need [Node.JS](http://www.nodejs.org) or [io.js](https://iojs.org/).

You need [npm](http://www.npmjs.com) **version 2.11** or newer for package scopes support. You can verify this by running

```
npm --version
```

You can update npm by running

```
npm install npm -g
```

### Downloading from npm

The widget is currently published in the [CTUâ€™s npm registry](https://repository.fit.cvut.cz/npm).
This registry is publicly accessible, so you only need to associate it with the `@cvut` scope:

```
npm config set @cvut:registry https://repository.fit.cvut.cz/npm
```

Then you can install the widget:

```
npm install @cvut/fittable-widget
```

### Building from source code

Besides Node, you will also need Ruby and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) for [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) stylesheets preprocessor.

Clone the repository and install all dependencies with:

```
script/setup
```

To build this project, you need [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). Run the main build task with:

```
grunt build
```

You can also transpile ES6 files for consumption in other projects with `build:npm` task (this will also run the `build` task):

```
grunt build:npm
```

The resulting build is located in `dist/` directory:

- `fittable.js` and `fittable.min.js` respectively are bundles for usage in web browsers,
- `js` directory contains transpiled code for use in other projects,
- `index.html` is an example project with mock-up data.

## Quick start

After a successful installation of the widget, include **fittable.min.js** from the dist folder into your project.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="fittable.min.js"></script>
```

Configure the widget and initialize it.

```javascript
var options = {
    callbacks: {
        search: mySearchCallback,
        data: myDataCallback,
        dateChange: myDateChangeCallback
    },
    locale: 'en'
};

var fittable = fittable( 'fittable', options );
```

This is basic configuration needed for running the widget. The next important step is to correctly implement the callbacks. For more information visit [our wiki](https://github.com/cvut/fittable-widget/wiki).
